The two objects that are going to be interacting are a rectangle and a circle.
I can check if the objects are intersecting by measuring the rectangles' edges distance away from the center of the circle. If it is less than the length of the radius of the circle, then this means that they are intersecting.
When the objects intersect, I am going to reverse their velocities (Dx and Dy) so that they "bounce off" each other. This will cause them to reverse directions.
