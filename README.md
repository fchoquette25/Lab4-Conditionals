**Fork this project into your own account.**

I haven't included all the files that come with a normal [editor.p5js.org](editor.p5js.org) project. All you need to do is copy the contents of `sketch.js` from here into editor and then back when you've made changes you want to commit. Typically, you should only commit working code. You could also make it so that you are committing only when you complete one of the lab tasks, but that's up to you.
